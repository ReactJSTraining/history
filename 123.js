JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript. The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in its Netscape Navigator web browser. JavaScript was first introduced and deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3 in December of 1995. When JavaScript was added to Internet Explorer, it had to be officially called "JScript", because Netscape owns the name "JavaScript". The choice of name proved to be a source of much confusion.

As of 2006, the latest version of the language is JavaScript 1.7, which corresponds to ECMA-262 Edition 3 like JavaScript 1.5, except for Array extras, Array and String generics, and pythonic generators and array comprehensions. ECMAScript, in simple terms, is a standardized version of JavaScript. The ECMA-357 standard specifies E4X (ECMAscript For XML), a language extension dealing with XML.
